## Hi, I‚Äôm Filippo üëã
Welcome to my GitHub!
I‚Äôve always been curious about how things really work, which led me to study **philosophy** and eventually dive deep into **data** while working in **supply chain**. I've always had a passion for the technical side of things‚Äîworking with data feels like the most exciting way to solve a problem, and I love finding solutions to complex challenges. Still I think there is also a fascinating world of people and processes to be explored-eventually the design of a technical solution must make life easier for operational teams and decision-makers alike. 

### üå± A Bit About Me
I‚Äôm a person who thrives on **learning** and **growth**. I‚Äôm always on the lookout for new skills, particularly those related to data, technology, and problem-solving. Whether it‚Äôs exploring a new tool, refining my code, or building something from scratch, I enjoy building and the process as much as refining the outcome. My work revolves around building tools and pipelines and my stack contains

Outside of work, I‚Äôm a big fan of **climbing**. Since moving to Berlin, I‚Äôve been bouldering regularly. It‚Äôs a humbling sport‚Äîthe better you get, the harder it is to break through to the next level. But that‚Äôs part of the appeal for me. It‚Äôs a challenge that keeps me coming back, no matter how tough it gets.

### ü§ù What I‚Äôm Looking For
I'm excited about continuing my journey in the field of data and leverage my passion for operations and processes. The big dream would be to become a data scientist and contribute to developing cool tools that help businesses I believe in to achieve more people and greater products. For now, my focus is on acquiring ever more experience and tools in the field of Analytics and Engineering, and become an invaluable contributor and a colleague.

I look forward to chatting with you -feel free to get in touch.
