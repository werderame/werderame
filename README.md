## Hi, I’m Filippo 👋
Welcome to my GitHub! I’m driven by one question: **what’s really happening underneath the surface**? I studied philosophy, then moved into supply chain, and eventually went deep into data because it’s the most practical way I know to turn messy reality into decisions, systems, and products.
I enjoy the technical craft — modeling data, writing clean code, designing pipelines — but I’m just as interested in the operating context: how teams make decisions, where processes break, and how a technical solution can genuinely make life easier for the people running the business.

### 🌱 A Bit About Me
I’m at my best when I can bring structure to ambiguity and ship something that people can rely on: a clear metric definition, a repeatable dataset, an automated report, or an analysis that directly changes how a team operates.
My current toolkit includes Python and SQL for analysis and automation, dbt for transformation and modeling, and BI tools for delivery and stakeholder alignment. I’ve worked with modern warehouse/lakehouse setups and I’m especially interested in the intersection between analytics and operations. Recent work includes supporting the SCM and Finance domains in Enpal (Greentech unicorn) with operational data pipelines, focusing on **inventory reconciliation** and **PnL**.

Outside of work, I climb — bouldering since moving to Berlin — and I’m into bread baking and woodworking. They’re a good reminder that progress comes from repetition, patience, and getting the fundamentals right.

### 🤝 What I’m Looking For
I’m looking for a role where data is close to decisions and operations — where analytics means enablement function that strengthens the business and eventually improves the product. Longer term, I’d love to move deeper into operations research / optimization (planning, capacity or scheduling) and help build systems that make companies more efficient and resilient. Right now, I’m focused on growing my experience in analytics and engineering, and contributing as a strong, reliable teammate who delivers.

I look forward to chatting with you -feel free to get in touch.
